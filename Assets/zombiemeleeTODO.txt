Bugs
-item not being picked up sometimes?
-Picking up zombies lol
-Fix Hit detection 
    -Improve hit direction calculation in hit directions
-Fix strange judder at end of sprint
-Take a look at general locomotion to improve it (juddering camera)
-Make hit detection use box cast 

Swimming
    -Animations for 8? directional
    -Turn directions for swimming
    -Add wading animations
    -Climb out of water
    
Climbing/Vaulting
        - Different speeds depending on velocity
        - Hand 
            - mostly done but need to account for player direction when placing hands as it's fine in one direction but wrong in the other
            - hand up orientation needs some work (works for 2m vault but not 1m vault) 
        - Better lining up and edge/height detection?
        - Proper 2m vault animation
        - Support for higher ledges - Jump to higher ledges?
        - Less magic number for size of gap to fit through
        - Hanging if there's no contact on other side of ledge - for rope sheets/player can jump if they want
        - Better way to hand OnAnimatorMove in PlayerCharacterState.cs (no flagging)
        - Check normal of hit to tell if the thing in front of us is a wall.
